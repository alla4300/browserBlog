1. UX 100 Humanities Project (Make Humanities Interesting)  
In this project we were tasked with the objective of creating a modernized and appealing version of the humanities page on the Laurier website.  

# My Angle 

The roles were distributed evenly however i was required to mainly present the project to the class. My thoughts on this project were quite moderate as i don't have much of an interest in the subject of Humanities. I think the idea was great and i believe if actually implemented it would attract more students to the program.
