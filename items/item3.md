3. Makers Lab "Plug'n'Play Projector"  
In this project we created a DIY projector that projects the screen of a smartphone or Nintendo Switch. This device could be build by anyone with basic materials. This project was also targeted towards encouraging people to stay home during the pandemic.  

# My Angle
In this project we were tasked with creating something that was constructed from recyclable materials. We created a DIY projector. I was tasked with gathering the materials needed as well as creating some power point slides and presenting to the class. This was my favorite project as I think it is something innovative and useful.
