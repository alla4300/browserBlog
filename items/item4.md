4. Interaction Design "Tinder Modification"  
In this Project we modified the Tinder application to encourage individuals to use the application to meet other people and create meaningful relationships throughout this pandemic as we are not able to socially interact with the public like we used to.  

 # My Angle
In this project we created an improved version of the application known as Tinder. My role was to collect data from interviewees and provide feedback. We then applied the feedback and created low fidelity models and medium fidelity models.
