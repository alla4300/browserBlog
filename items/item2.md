2. Makers Lab "Compact Desk Box"  
In this Project we had to hack the conventional box and create something that is useful as well as something that would relate to the needs of people during this pandemic.  

# My Angle 
In this project we were tasked to create something that was crafted from basic and recyclable materials. We all took part in the brain storming session. I then created rough sketches of the product and presented the project to the class after the final prototype was completed.
